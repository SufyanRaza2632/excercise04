The output generated by both the versions are same,

The major differences in the source code of both verions are

-Since C is a static type Programming language thats why we had to explicitly mention the type of each variable
 whereas Python is a dynamic type programming language, there fore there was no need to mention the type of variable.

-Also since the Pyhton takes the type of input as string, due to which type casting was used in several places.
-In C we can tell what input we are expecting, due to which there was no type casting in this particular example.

-Apart from the differences there are a lot of similarities, if we look as a whole the basic algorithm is exactly the same in both the versions
